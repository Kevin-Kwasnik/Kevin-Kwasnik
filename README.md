  <h2>Philosophical Data Scientist</h2>
  <p>Building bridges between thought and bits, one line of code at a time.</p>
  <p>Data scientist by day, philosopher by night (and sometimes in between code reviews).</p>
  <p>☕️ Exploring the universe of data with a skeptical eye and a curious mind. Ask me about AI, ethics, and the meaning of it all.</p>
  <p>Decoding the secrets of code and consciousness. Join me on the quest to understand how machines think (and if they should).</p>
  <p>I'm currently learning about Causal Inference and SLM/LLMs, as well as deepening my experience in Azure.</p>
